# BCR_TCR_Interference
This repository is associated with the submitted manuscript *Single-cell RNA sequencing analyses: interference by the genes that encode the B-cell and T-cell receptors* (Sundell *et al.*, 2022). 

All R code used to perform the processing and analyses in the manuscript can be found within the repository. The sequencing data for the peripheral memory B cells and bone marrow early B-lineage cells can be found in ArrayExpress, in the form of FASTQ files, under the accession number [E-MTAB-12346](). The peripheral CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell data can be found via the [10x Genomics website](https://www.10xgenomics.com/resources/datasets/cd-8-plus-t-cells-of-healthy-donor-1-1-standard-3-0-2). Finally, the relevant VDJ-seq data for the peripheral memory B cell sample can be found in the [data/](data/) directory.
